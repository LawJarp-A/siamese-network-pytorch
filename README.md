# siamese-network-pytorch
A Siamese Network implementation in Pytorch, with additional pytorch-lightning support for training

## Simple Siamese network
* Contains code on how to implement a Pytorch `Dataset` class to get images to train a Siamese network
* Contains code on how to implemnet a Siamese Network model to train, wrapped in`pytorch-lightning`

## Siamese network with triplet mining
* Triplet minining is a technique used to increse efficieny and converging rate with triplet loss
